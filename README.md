# RedisVagrant
A quick little setup cradle for Redis to mirror AWS's ElastiCache service for local dev.

Requirements
------------
You need to have VirtualBox installed, obvs. Everything else is inside the VM. 

Installation
------------
Super simple, we just launch a VM using:

```
vagrant up
```

Any issue can probably be fixed with a quick ```vagrant provision```
